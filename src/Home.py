- **Problem**: Large enterprises like 7-Eleven have been fined millions of dollars for underpaying their employees. Whether intentional or not, this has not only lead to massive fines, significant financial losses as a result of poor reputation, and low morale among employees.
- **How it works**: Bob, powered by Langchain, uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to chat on tabular data (CSV). It extracts the most up-to-date legislation from NSW Fairwork website to check for compliance. The entire application is built using Streamlit.
- **Features**: Bob supports CSV format as employee payroll dataset.
